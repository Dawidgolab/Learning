Public API - application programming interface

* Two samples of API:

Automatic online text translation:
When you use an online text translation application such as Google Translate,
the application uses an API to send the text you want to translate to Google's server.
There, the text is processed and translated, and then a reply with the translated text
is sent back to the app for you to see.

Weather on your phone:
Weather apps on the phone often use weather service APIs. When you open the app,
it sends a query to the server, asking for current weather data for your location.
The server processes the query and returns a response with the weather forecast,
which the app displays on your phone.
