-> Object - Is a container for variables and subject
functions that are related to each other for further reuse
Object has an attribute e.g:
Object : Window
Attribute : length, width , height, color

-> class - it is a container for the objects
class User:
      pass
* pass - this is a temporary word, which we will later turn into code

-> attribute -> feature which describes the object

-> Method  - the funtion that operates on the object

-> class instance -> this is an object that came out of the form (class)
a = 13 -> object
print(type(a)) ->    <class 'int'>

class User:
    pass

dawid = User() # Dont forget about the ()
paweł = User()

dawid.age = 26
paweł.age = 17

print(dawid.age)
print(paweł.age)
